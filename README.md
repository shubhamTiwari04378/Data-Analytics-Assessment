# Data-Analytics-Assessment
Project: User Behavior and Order Analysis This project analyzes datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. The objective is to derive insights into the relationship between cooking sessions and orders, identify popular dishes, and explore demographic factors influencing user behavior.

Data Merging: Combine all datasets to form a unified final_data DataFrame using keys like User ID and Session ID.

Analysis: Explore the relationship between cooking sessions and orders. Identify the most popular dishes based on order frequency. Analyze demographic factors (e.g., age) and their impact on order behavior.

Visualizations: Average Order Amount by Meal Type: A bar plot showing average spending per meal type. Total Orders by Meal Type: A bar plot highlighting the popularity of meal types.

Reporting: Summarize findings and provide actionable business recommendation

Business Recommendations 1.Focus on High-Revenue Meal Types: Promote meal types with higher average order amounts through targeted campaigns. 2.Enhance Popular Dishes:Ensure availability of popular dishes and consider creating variations to attract repeat orders. 3.Target Specific Demographics:Use age-based segmentation to design personalized offers and promotions.
